# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fabric explorer: expanding an item now shows **that item's database** (Tables, Views,
  Programmability, Schemas…) directly. Previously the inline explorer treated the item like a
  server and listed every database on the workspace's shared SQL endpoint, duplicating the
  workspace's own item list one level down. "Refresh objects" added to the item context menu.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-18

- Fabric explorer: chevron on an item opens an **inline object explorer** (databases → tables →
  columns/keys/indexes, same tree as Servers) without leaving the panel.
- Fabric explorer: **Recent** section (last six items you opened) above Pinned.
- Fabric explorer: a SQL database's **SQL analytics endpoint** appears as a child row and opens
  against the workspace's warehouse host.
- Fabric explorer: capacity SKU next to the region when the registration grants
  `Capacity.Read.All` (silently skipped otherwise).
- Lakehouse context menu: **Export results here…** opens Save-results with that lakehouse
  preselected (Delta, schema pre-filled).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-18

- **Fabric explorer**: a Fabric icon on the left rail (Ctrl+Shift+B). Sign in once with your Entra
  account (an existing Entra connection is adopted silently), browse every workspace you can reach
  and its warehouses, lakehouse SQL endpoints, SQL databases and mirrored databases. Double-click
  opens a connected query tab, no saved connection needed. Pin favourites, search, *Save to
  Servers*, copy the connection string, open in the Fabric portal.
- **Export to OneLake**: the Save-results dialog can target a lakehouse. Delta tables land in
  `Tables/` (queryable from the lakehouse SQL endpoint right away); Parquet, CSV, Excel and the other
  formats land in `Files/`. Schema-enabled lakehouses are detected (`defaultSchema`) and Delta
  tables go under `Tables/<schema>/`, defaulting to the lakehouse's schema.
- Entra: one refresh token now serves SQL, the Fabric REST API and OneLake once the app
  registration's permissions are consented to (Power BI Service → Workspace.Read.All,
  Item.Read.All, OneLake.ReadWrite.All; optionally Azure Storage → user_impersonation).
- Agent verbs: `fabric_state`, `fabric {action}`, `export {lakehouse, name}`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-18

- Check for updates: Help → Check for Updates…, plus a once-per-start check (Settings → Updates to turn
  it off or stop skipping a version).
- Database switcher: the toolbar combo is always a switcher when connected. A failed list keeps the
  current database and offers *Refresh list* (with the error on hover); engines without `USE` switch
  by reconnecting.
- The tab follows a `USE` run from the editor (title, status bar, completion catalog).
- Fabric Warehouse's per-statement "Statement ID / Query hash" info lines are shown muted, without
  the Msg/Level header.
- Release builds no longer contain the dev-only egui_agent channel.
- Build: faster release workflow (prebuilt packager), Linux-only CI, macOS dmg named without spaces.
