# Cobalt SQL Works — V1 alpha notes for the founder

*Written during the build, 2026-09-17. Update as the alpha evolves.*

## Run it

```
cargo run -p cobalt-app --release            # or: target\release\cobalt.exe
COBALT_AGENT=1 cargo run -p cobalt-app       # dev build with the agent channel on (pipe: cobalt.agent)
```

Data lives in `%APPDATA%\Cobalt\Cobalt SQL Works\` (Windows): `config\settings.toml`,
`data\cobalt.db` (library, history, tab snapshots). Passwords go to Windows Credential Manager
under service `cobalt-sqlworks`. Spill files go to the temp dir and are cleaned on startup.

## What to try first

1. **Servers → +** — add your SQL Server (SQL login or Windows auth). "Test connection", then
   "Save & Connect". Expand the server in the tree: databases → Tables → columns/keys/indexes.
2. **F5** runs the tab (selection if any); **Ctrl+Enter** runs the statement under the cursor;
   **Ctrl+L** estimated plan; **Ctrl+M** toggles actual plan for subsequent runs.
3. Big result: `SELECT * FROM <big table>` stops at 10,000 rows with a **Fetch more / Fetch all**
   bar. 2M rows fetch in ~4 s locally; sort/filter work on the full set.
4. Right-click the grid: Copy / with headers / Markdown / JSON / INSERT / IN list;
   **Save results as…** → CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, Markdown, **Parquet, Arrow, Delta**.
5. Double-click a cell (or Enter) → cell viewer (pretty JSON / XML / hex).
6. **History** (left strip) — every run, searchable; double-click reopens.
7. **Ctrl+Shift+P** — command palette. **File → Import Azure Data Studio connections**.

## Entra ID / Fabric — needs your app registration first

Interactive sign-in, device code, `az login` and service-principal flows are implemented and
unit-tested against a mock identity provider, but no live Entra tenant was available during
the build. Before testing Fabric we need the app registration (see `decisions/D004_entra_auth.md`):
mobile/desktop platform, redirect URI `http://localhost`, public client flows on, delegated
`Azure SQL Database / user_impersonation`. Put the client ID in Settings → Connections.

## Known gaps in this alpha

- Windows Integrated auth is implemented (SSPI via the driver) but untested here (Docker SQL Server = SQL auth only).
- Object-explorer filter dialog, group-by-schema, freeze columns, transposed view: V1.x.
- Multi-cursor / folding in the editor: V2.
- Plan comparison and Plan-Explorer-class analysis: V2.
- The agent's `snapshot` sometimes returns only the root node between interactions (egui_agent/AccessKit incremental tree); clicks by label still work. Worth a look in egui_agent.
- macOS: untested; Linux: built in Docker (see README) but not yet exercised on a desktop.
